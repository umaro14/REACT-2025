# Babel ==> translate other code into JavaScript.

const button = <button>Hello</button>  ==> this is JSX.
Our Browser does not understand JSX it only understands JavaScript. So we need to convert JSX into JavaScript. 
This is done by an external library called Babel.

# Guard Operator(&&)
The && operator is called the guard operator. It is used to prevent the execution of a function if
a condition is not met.
-if value-1 is true, the result will be value-2
-if value-1 is false, the result will be false.
